##### *ScheduleStorage Interface*

The **ScheduleStorage** interface defines the necessary methods that the **Controller** requires to read and write to a file type. It allows the data to persist when the user exits the application. Currently, all schedule files are saved as an XML file type format but you can extend it to other file types by implementing this interface. This interface follows the Interface Segregation Principle as defines method that is specific for the **Controller** use.

*Notable APIs:* [`ScheduleStorage.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/linenux/storage/ScheduleStorage.java)

| Return type | Method and Description                                                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Schedule    | `loadScheduleFromFile()`: reads a file and returns the schedule from the file.    |
| void        | `saveScheduleToFile(Schedule schedule)`: writes the given schedule into the file. |
| Boolean     | `hasScheduleFile()`: checks if the schedule file exits.                           |

#### View Component

<img src="images/developerGuide/view.png">

The **View Component** uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in the matching `.fxml` files that are found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. Similarly, the look of these UI parts are styled in their respective `.css` files found in the same folder.

The **TodoBox**, **DeadlineBox** and **EventBox** follows the Observable Pattern as it listens to changes in the states list of the **Schedule** class. Also whenever there is a list command, it listens to the filtered task lists and updates the view accordingly.

##### *AbstractCommand Class*

As many of the commands are similar in their implementation of some of the interface methods, we have abstracted the implementation into the **AbstractCommand** class.

*Notable APIs:* [`AbstractCommand.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/linenux/command/AbstractCommand.java)

| Return type | Method and Description                                         | 
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------|
| String      | `getPattern()`: returns regex pattern.                         |
| void        | `setAlias(String alias)`: set a new alias for the command.     |
| void        | `removeAlias(String alias)`: removes an alias for the command. |

##### *AddArgumentParser Class*

The **Either** class is a data structure inspired by the functional programming world and it is used to represent an operation that can have two possible outcomes. For example, when parsing something, the output is either the result, or an error message. In the **AddArgumentParser** class, the desired result is the creation of a new **Task** object, while the error message happens when there are problems with parsing the user input. To improve code readability, we can use the Filter Pattern to filter through the different fields of a **Task**, and only proceeding to the next field if the criteria is met.

``` java
    public Either<Task, CommandResult> parse(String argument) {
        this.parseResult = this.genericParser.parse(argument);

        return Either.<Task, CommandResult>left(new Task(""))
                .bind(this::extractTaskName)
                .bind(this::extractStartTime)
                .bind(this::extractEndTime)
                .bind(this::extractTags)
                .bind(this::ensureValidDateCombination)
                .bind(this::ensureValidEventTimes);
    }
```

## Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The **LogsCenter** class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `linenux.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

#### Making a Release

GitHub automatically treats Git tags as releases. However, GitHub also allows arbitrary files (for e.g., built binaries) to be included with these release. Travis is configured to attach the built JAR files to these releases.

There is no extra steps needed to make use of this feature - Travis has been configured to pick up tagged commits and attach
the appropriate files.

#### Managing Dependecies

Linenux depends on a handful of third-party libraries. These dependencies are declared in `build.gradle` under the aptly-named
`dependencies` block. Gradle will manage (download, update, or delete) these dependencies as necessary (for example, before a
build) to ensure that the build environment has the correct set of dependencies.
