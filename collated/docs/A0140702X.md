##### *CommandManager Class*

The **CommandManager** class holds a list of commands and is responsible for delegating the user input to the right command. It follows the Open-Closed Principle as it is easy to add new commands (open to extension) without having to modify other parts of the code (closed to modification).

The sequence diagram below shows the flow of a typical command.

<img src="images/developerGuide/sequence.png">

Since some commands require some form of user response, we will first check if any commands are awaiting user response. Note that at most one command can be awaiting user response at any point in time. If there are no command waiting for user response, it is assumed that the user entered a command and the **CommandManager** class will assign the right command based on the user input. Finally, a feedback in the form of a **CommandResult** instance will be returned and displayed in the **View** component.

#### Activity Diagram

<img src="images/developerGuide/activity.png">

The above activity diagram shows the generic flow of activities in Linenux. The top half of the diagram shows the process of the program initialization. Linenux will show alert and exit if there are problems with the Config file as the **Config** class has the crucial responsibility of getting the Schedule filepath. On the other hand, not being able to create or read the Schedule file will not exit the program as it only affects the saving functionality and does not compromise the other functionalities in Linenux. The bottom half of the diagram shows the user interaction with the program and how Linenux deals with the user input.

#### Continuous Integration

Travis CI is a Continuous Integration platform for GitHub projects. It runs the projects' tests automatically whenever new code is pushed to the repository. This ensures that existing functionality and features have not been broken by the changes.

Whenever you push code to the repository, the current Travis CI set up will:
* Runs the `./gradlew test` command

As a developer, there is no extra steps needed to use Travis. Travis will automatically build all pushes to the main
repository.

Also, email notifications will be sent to the relevant developers when a push breaks or fixes the test suite.

Build statuses are also shown for each pull request for the convenience of the reviewers. Do take note that builds for pull
request might be outdated (for e.g., when more commits are added to the destination branch). Hence, it is highly recommended
for the reviewers to perform a rebuild (either via Travis or manually) before accepting a pull request.

#### Appendix E : Product Survey

<img src="images/developerGuide/survey.png"/>

Our group has surveyed 4 different task managers, Google Calendar, Todoist, Wunderlist and Fantastical. Below is a summary of what we have found:

*UI*

All the 4 task managers had great and easy to understand UIs. The main issue is that none of them are catered for users like Jim who prefer typing. For example, Google Calendar allows users to quick add a task, but other functionalities such as editing tasks still requires user to click and navigate through pages. For Jim who accesses the app so frequently and who is more proficient in typing, it is inefficient to need to navigate through many pages and require so many mouse clicks to handle one action.

*Functionalities*

Generally, the 4 task managers share the same basic functionalities to add and maintain tasks. After trying out the additional features that each of the application had, we decided to included the following features:

1. Searching for freetime.
2. Reminders.

Noting that Jim follows the Inbox Zero email management plan and how he will be adding all his tasks into the application, we would be able to look at all his events to judge when he is free. Hence, we believe that adding this feature would be able to help Jim better manage his tasks as he would be able to rasily find his free timeslots and schedule his work accordingly.

We decided to add reminders as Jim can use it to remind himself about his important deadlines and events, especially in the case where his task list is flooded. Furthermore, he can use reminders as a way to remind himself to clear certain pre-requisites to a task.

#### Editing Tasks and Reminders

##### *Edit*

In a perfect world, everything will go according to plan. Unfortunately, things change all the time and we need to be able to respond accordingly. Thus, to make any changes to your tasks, we have the `edit` command.

It uses the same searching mechanism as `remind` and it will update the respective fields of the task to their new values. However, do take note that any new tags you add to a task with replace all existing tags.

Also, to remove fields, we will use a dash as shown in the examples below. You can remove all fields except for`n/TASK_NAME`.

*Format:*

` edit KEYWORDS [n/TASK] [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [#/TAG]...`

*Examples:*

```
Explanation: Adding an event with tags 'hobby' and 'rest day'.
> add play golf st/tomorrow 7.00am et/tomorrow 9.00am #/hobby #/rest day

Explanation: Changing the name of the event from 'play golf' to 'play chess'.
> edit golf n/play chess

Explanation: Changing the starting and ending time of the event 'play chess'.
> edit chess st/tomorrow 7.00pm et/tomorrow 9.00pm

Explanation: Replacing both tags 'hobby' and 'rest day' with the tag 'fun'.
> edit chess #/fun

Explanation: Changing 'play chess' from an event to a to-do.
> edit chess st/- et/-

Explanation: Removing all tags associated with the to-do 'play chess'.
> edit chess #/-
```

##### *Editr*

`editr` is the `edit` command for reminders. It works similar to the `edit` command, with the same earching mechanism which searches for a reminder by its note. However, since both the time and note fields are compulsory, you will not be able to remove any of the fields.

*Format:*

`editr KEYWORDS [t/TIME] [n/NOTE]`

*Examples:*

```
Explanation: Setting a reminder for the event 'house warming' with the note 'buy groceries'.
> remind house warming t/tomorrow 7.00am n/buy groceries

Explanation: Changing the time of a reminder with note.
> editr buy groceries t/tomorrow 6:00am
```

```
###### \UserGuide.md

##### *Today*

Seeing as how you might want to know today's tasks frequently, instead of typing `list st/today 12.00am et/today 11.59pm`, we made it into a command itself! Your events that occur today will be shown as well.

*Format:*

`today`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: List all tasks today.
> today
```

##### *Tomorrow*

Similar as the command `today`, this is a syntactic sugar which is equivalent to `list st/tomorrow 12.00am et/tomorrow 11:59pm`. Your events that occur tomorrow will be shown as well.

*Format:*

`tomorrow`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: List all tasks the next day.
> tomorrow
```
#### Viewing a Task

##### *View*

The command `list` only provides the general details surrounding a task. To see all the reminders associated with a task, use `view`.

*Format:*

`view KEYWORDS`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: View details regarding the deadline.
> view CS2101 assignment
```

#### Seeking Help

##### *Help*

We all need a helping hand every once in a while. Lucky for you, we are with you every step of the way. If you have forgotten how to use a command, or want to know more about what Linenux can do, just type `help` and we will tell you all that you need to know. Help also displays the current aliases for the command.

*Format:*

`help [COMMMAND_NAME]`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: Help for all commands.
> help

Explanation: Help for information command.
> help information
```

<img src="images/userGuide/help.png">

#### Exiting Linenux

##### *Exit*

When you are done for the day, to exit the program, you can just type `exit`!

*Format:*

`exit`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: Exits the program.
> exit
```
