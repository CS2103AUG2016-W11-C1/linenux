#### Editing Tasks and Reminders

##### *Edit*

In a perfect world, everything will go according to plan. Unfortunately, things change all the time and we need to be able to respond accordingly. Thus, to make any changes to your tasks, we have the `edit` command.

It uses the same searching mechanism as `remind` and it will update the respective fields of the task to their new values. However, do take note that any new tags you add to a task with replace all existing tags.

Also, to remove fields, we will use a dash as shown in the examples below. You can remove all fields except for`n/TASK_NAME`.

*Format:*

` edit KEYWORDS [n/TASK] [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [#/TAG]...`

*Examples:*

```
Explanation: Adding an event with tags 'hobby' and 'rest day'.
> add play golf st/tomorrow 7.00am et/tomorrow 9.00am #/hobby #/rest day

Explanation: Changing the name of the event from 'play golf' to 'play chess'.
> edit golf n/play chess

Explanation: Changing the starting and ending time of the event 'play chess'.
> edit chess st/tomorrow 7.00pm et/tomorrow 9.00pm

Explanation: Replacing both tags 'hobby' and 'rest day' with the tag 'fun'.
> edit chess #/fun

Explanation: Changing 'play chess' from an event to a to-do.
> edit chess st/- et/-

Explanation: Removing all tags associated with the to-do 'play chess'.
> edit chess #/-
```

##### *Editr*

`editr` is the `edit` command for reminders. It works similar to the `edit` command, with the same earching mechanism which searches for a reminder by its note. However, since both the time and note fields are compulsory, you will not be able to remove any of the fields.

*Format:*

`editr KEYWORDS [t/TIME] [n/NOTE]`

*Examples:*

```
Explanation: Setting a reminder for the event 'house warming' with the note 'buy groceries'.
> remind house warming t/tomorrow 7.00am n/buy groceries

Explanation: Changing the time of a reminder with note.
> editr buy groceries t/tomorrow 6:00am
```
