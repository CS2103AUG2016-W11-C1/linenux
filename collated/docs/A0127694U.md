##### *Task and Reminder Class*

We classify all types of tasks into three categories:

1. **Deadlines** - tasks that have an end time but no start time.
2. **Events** - tasks that have both start and end times.
3. **To-dos** - tasks that have neither start nor end times.

Note that we do not allow tasks with start time but without end time. A **Task** object is unique and no two **Task** object can have the same task name, start time and end time.

A **Task** object can have tags and reminders. Tags are strings that allow users to further categorize their tasks, while reminders notify users on certain key points as the task draw nearer to its end time.

#### Controller Component

<img src="images/developerGuide/controller.png">

##### *ControlUnit Class*

The **ControlUnit** class is the "brain" of Linenux and is responsible for setting up the application. Its responsibilities are:

1. Retreiving the appropriate schedule file from storage and initializing the **Schedule** class.
2. Initializing an instance of the supported commands.
3. Passes the user input to the **Command** class.
4. Relays any feedback from the **Command** class to the **View** component.

##### *TimeParserManager Class and TimeParser Interface*

These two classes work similarly as the **CommandManager** class and **Command** interface. The **TimeParserManager** class is responsible for delegating the user input to the right **TimeParser** instance.

*Notable APIs:* [`TimeParserManager.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/linenux/control/TimeParserManager.java)

| Return type   | Method and Description                                                                              |
| --------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Boolean       | `canParse(String userInput)`: checks if manager can parse the time format.                          |
| CommandResult | `delegateTimeParser(String userInput)`: assigns the right TimeParser that can read the time format. |

*Notable APIs:* [`TimeParser.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/linenux/time/parser/TimeParser.java)

| --------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Boolean       | `respondTo(String userInput)`: checks if TimeParser can parse the time format.     |
| LocalDateTime | `parse(String userInput)`: converts the time string into a LocalDateTime instance. |

## Dev Ops

#### Build Automation

Gradle is a build automation tool. It can automate build-related tasks such as:
* Running tests
* Managing library dependencies
* Analysing code for style compliance

The gradle configuration for this project is defined in the build script `build.gradle`.

Gradle can either be invoked using the `gradle` command if Gradle is installed system-wide or the included wrapper scripts
`gradlew` and `gradlew.bat`.

This project supports the following Gradle tasks (which can be invoked by running `gradle TASK_NAME`):

- `clean`: Deletes built artifacts. This is helpful when outdated build artifacts is interfering with the latest build
environment.
- `build`: Builds the project for distribution. In particular, `build/distributions/linenux.zip` is generated and is suitable
for public consumption.
- `test`: Run the test suite. This includes GUI tests in headless mode.

Gradle will automatically download the required dependencies when necessary.
