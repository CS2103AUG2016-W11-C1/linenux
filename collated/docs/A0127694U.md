## About

Everyone of us will face, at some point in our lives, the feeling of being overwhelmed by the amount of things to do: meeting project deadlines, attending a friend's wedding ceremony, paying the bills and the list goes on. This hectic pace of life is the new normal, but it doesn't mean we have to suffer in silence. We believe that everyone should have control over their own lives and Linenux is the key to achieving just that.

Linenux is essentially a task organiser. It helps you to prioritise your tasks by urgency and importance, so that you can better make use of your time by focussing on things that matter. What sets Linenux apart from other task managers is its simplicity and efficiency. It requires only a single line of command. No mouse clicks needed and no gimmicks. Linenux works only as fast as you can type, making it a perfect fit for those who prefer typing.

Without further ado, let's get started!

#### Renaming Tags

##### *Rename*

Renaming a tag will change all tasks with that tag to the new tag.

*Format:*

`rename OLD_TAG #/NEW_TAG`

*Examples:*

```
* Rename tag 'assignments' to 'nus assignments'.
> rename assignments #/nus assignments
```

#### Marking Tasks as Done

##### *Done*

Yes! You’ve just completed a task. Since it’s completed, you wouldn’t want to see it popping up as a task that is incomplete. Thus, type `done`, along with the task name to mark it as completed.

*Format:*

`done KEYWORDS`

*Examples:*

```
* Mark to-do 'write user guide' as done.
> done write user guide.
```

##### *Undone*

In cases where we accidentally mark an incomplete task as done, we can use the `undone` command to mark the task as incomplete.

*Format:*

`undone KEYWORDS`

*Examples:*

```
* Mark to-do `write user guide` as undone.
> undone write user guide
```

#### Deleting Tasks and Reminders

##### *Delete*

At times, tasks or reminders might become redundant. For example, a scheduled meeting might be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. Deleting a task will remove all its reminders.

*Format:*

```
delete KEYWORDS
```

*Example:*

```
* Delete an event 'cs2103 meeting'.
> delete cs2103 meeting
```

##### *Deleter*

`deleter` is the delete command for reminders. When you delete a reminder will, you will not delete the task that it is associated with.

*Format:*

```
deleter KEYWORDS
```

*Example:*

```
* Delete a reminder 'buy groceries'.
> delete buy groceries
```

##### *Clear*

To delete multiple tasks in the same category, the `clear` command can be used. When used on its own, it will delete all tasks marked as done. You can also delete a set of tasks with the same tag by specifying the tag name.

*Format:*

`clear [#/TAG]`

*Example:*

```
* Clears all tasks marked as done.
> clear

* Clears all tasks with tag 'assignment'.
> clear #/assignment
```
