#### Functional Walkthrough

*This section is a scenario driven, step-by-step introduction on how to use Linenux. For a more in-depth coverage of the commands, refer to our [Commands](#commands) section in the user guide.*

*Step 1: Adding a task.*

You have to buy groceries from the local supermarket today as your relatives are coming to visit for the weekend. You decide to remind youself with the aid of Linenux. Type the following line in the command box:

`> add buy groceries et/today 7.00pm`

*Step 2: Setting a reminder.*

You worry that you might not have enough cash to buy groceries and decide to withdraw money from a nearby ATM machine at your workplace. Type the following line in the command box:

`> remind buy groceries n/withdraw money et/today 6.00pm`

*Step 3: Making spelling mistakes.*

Linenux provides a quick way to fix typing errors. Type the following line in the command box:

`> addd play the piano`

Typing the above line with the spelling mistake will cause a prompt to appear on the bottom-right corner of the window.

`> yes `

Replying yes to the prompt will add the task 'play the piano' without having to type everything again. How convenient!

*Step 4: Marking a task as done.*

It is 8.00pm already and you have just finished buying the groceries. Type the following line in the command box:

`> done buy groceries`

This command will prevent the task from showing up again in subsequent `list` or `today` commands.

*Step 5: Becoming proficient*

You are very impressed with what you have seen thus far and want to learn more about the amazing things you can do with Linenux. Type the following line in the command box:

`> help`

This brings up the list of Linenux commands with their description and format. It is for a quick in-app look-up. Continue to the next section if you want a complete rundown of the details of commands.

## Commands

*Notes:*

1. *The `command` word must be the first word in the sentence.*
2. *All commands and their respective fields are case-insensitive.*
3. *The order of the fields do not matter.*
4. *Optional fields are enclosed in square brackets `[]`.*
5. *The notation `...` means that you can have more than one instance of that field.*

#### Adding Tasks and Reminders

##### *Add*

Linenux supports 3 kinds of tasks:

1. **To-dos**    (Tasks without start and end times)
2. **Deadlines** (Tasks with end times only)
3. **Events**    (Tasks with start and end times)

Adding a task has never been this easy. Just indicate the appropriate fields and we will automatically assign the newly created task to one of the three categories above.

*Format:*

`add TASK [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [#/TAG]...`

*Examples:*

```
Explanation: Adding a to-do with tag 'trump'.
> add watch videos on presidential election #/trump

Explanation: Adding a deadline with tags 'household' and 'bills and money'.
> add pay utility bills et/tomorrow 5.00pm #/household #/bills and money

Explanation: Adding an event with tag 'household'.
> add house warming st/tomorrow 7.00pm et/tomorrow 9.00pm #/household
```

##### *Remind*

Setting reminders is as simple as adding a task. Just specify the appropriate fields and we will assign the reminder to the task that you want. Reminders will show up on the display panel upon launch or when the commands `list`, `today` and `tomorrow` are entered.

*Format:*

`remind KEYWORDS t/TIME n/NOTES`

*Examples:*

```
Explanation: Setting a reminder for the event 'house warming' with the note 'buy groceries'.
> remind house warming t/tomorrow 7.00am n/buy groceries
```

<img src="images/userGuide/remind.png">

*Did you know?*

Have you wondered why we use the word `KEYWORDS` rather than `TASK`? This is because the `remind` command actually searches for task names containing those keywords! For example, consider the scenario below :

```
> add cs2101 assignment et/tomorrow 11.59pm
> add cs2103 assignment et/tomorrow 11.59pm
> remind assignment n/finish assignment t/tomorrow 10.00pm
```

<img src="images/userGuide/multipleResult.png">

In this scenario, since there are multiple task names with the keyword `assignment`, both results are returned and you get to choose, via specifying an index, which task is the reminder for. This searching mechanism is implemented for all commands with the field `KEYWORDS`. How cool is that?

#### Listing Tasks and Reminders

##### *List*

The default behaviour of the `list` command returns the list of all incomplete tasks and reminders. This may not be particularly helpful as you may have a lot of outstanding tasks. Luckily, you are able to search for tasks by specifying the various fields. For example, you can list tasks that have the same tag.

Also, if you need to see the tasks that you have completed, simply add the `d/DONE` field which works as follows:

1. d/yes - Shows only completed tasks.
2. d/all - Shows completed tasks along with incompleted tasks.

*Format:*

`list [KEYWORDS] [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [#/TAG] [d/DONE]`

*Examples:*

```
Explanation: Lists all incomplete tasks and reminders.
> list

Explanation: Lists all incomplete tasks and reminders containing the word `assignment`.
> list assignment

Explanation: List all incomplete tasks and reminders from now to 25 December 2016, 11.59pm.
  (Assuming now is some time before 25 Decemeber 2016.)
> list et/2016-12-25 11.59pm

Explanation: List all incomplete tasks and reminders from 16 October 2016, 12.00am to 25 December 2016, 11.59pm.
> list st/2016-10-16 12.00am et/2016-12-25 11.59pm

Explanation: List all completed tasks.
> list d/yes

Explanation: List both completed and incompleted tasks.
> list d/all

Explanation: List all incomplete tasks with tag 'nus'.
> list #/nus

Explanation: List all incomplete tasks from 16 October 2016, 12.00am to 25 December 2016, 11.59pm and with tags 'nus'.
> list st/2016-10-16 12.00am et/2016-12-25 11.59pm #/nus
```

##### *Today*

Seeing as how you might want to know today's tasks frequently, instead of typing `list st/today 12.00am et/today 11.59pm`, we made it into a command itself! Your events that occur today will be shown as well.

*Format:*

`today`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: List all tasks today.
> today
```

##### *Tomorrow*

Similar as the command `today`, this is a syntactic sugar which is equivalent to `list st/tomorrow 12.00am et/tomorrow 11:59pm`. Your events that occur tomorrow will be shown as well.

*Format:*

`tomorrow`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: List all tasks the next day.
> tomorrow
```
#### Viewing a Task

##### *View*

The command `list` only provides the general details surrounding a task. To see all the reminders associated with a task, use `view`.

*Format:*

`view KEYWORDS`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: View details regarding the deadline.
> view CS2101 assignment
```

#### Undoing Previous Command

##### *Undo*

We all make mistakes in life, but we believe in second chances. After all, we are mere mortals. With the `undo` command, we will turn a blind eye to your previous commands. However, do note that not all mistakes can be forgiven. Only the following commands can be undone:

*Undo-able Commands:*

1. `add`
2. `remind`
3. `edit`
4. `editr`
5. `rename`
6. `done`
7. `undone`
8. `delete`
9. `deleter`
10. `clear`

You can undo up to ten such commands.

*Format:*

`undo`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: Undo previous undo-able commands, if any.
> undo
```

```
