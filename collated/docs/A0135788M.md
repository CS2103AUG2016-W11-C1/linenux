## Design

#### Architecture

<img src="images/developerGuide/mvc.png"/>

Linenux follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern which is made up of 3 main components.

1. **Model** is where Linenux's data objects are stored. It is independent from the view and controller.
2. **View** is the window that our user sees and interacts with. It updates whenever there are changes to the model.
3. **Controller** is the decision maker and the glue between model and view.

#### Model Component

<img src="images/developerGuide/model.png">

##### *Schedule and State class*

The **Schedule** class stores the data of **Task** and **Reminder** instances in-memory. To facillitate the `undo` command, we introduce an intermediary class known as **State**. A **State** object represents the state of the **Schedule** class at a point in time. A new **State** object is added to the **Schedule** class whenever a task or reminder is created, updated or deleted. Thus, to `undo` a command, we can simply discard the most recent **State**.

To properly capture the above behaviour, we have made **State**, **Task** and **Reminder** classes immutable. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This means that any modification to a **Task** or **Reminder** object will cause a new **State** object to be added. This is why any methods that mutate the data should do so via the **Schedule** class. This follows the Momento Pattern as it provides the **Schedule** class with the ability to restore itself to its previous state.

Specifically, we have exposed three mutation methods:

1. `addTask`
2. `updateTask`
3. `deleteTask`

*Notable APIs:* [`Schedule.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/linenux/model/Schedule.java)

| Return type  | Method and Description                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| void         | `addTask(Task task)`: Adds the task into the schedule.                                                      |
| void         | `updateTask(Task originalTask, Task newTask)`: Updates the original task in the schedule with the new task. |
| void         | `deleteTask(Task task)`: Deletes the task from the schedule.                                                |
| State        | `getMostRecentState()`: Returns the most recent state of schedule.                                          |
| void         | `addState(State)`: Adds a new state into the list of states.                                                |

##### *Command Interface*

**Command** interface defines the necessary methods that **CommandManager** requires to allocate the correct command based on the user input. This follows the Command Pattern as the client, in this case the **CommandManager** class can treat each command type as a black box, calling the four methods in the table below whenever there is a user input.

*Notable APIs:* [`Command.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/linenux/command/Command.java)

| Return type   | Method and Description                                                                                           |
| --------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Boolean       | `respondTo(String userInput)`: checks if command responds to userInput.                                          |
| CommandResult | `execute(String userInput)`: executes the command.                                                               |
| Boolean       | `isAwaitingUserResponse()`: checks if the command is awaiting for a response from the user.                      |
| CommandResult | `processUserResponse(String userInput)`: carries out user response.                                              |

##### *GenericParser Class*

For complex commands that requires searching and mutating the data, we have abstracted the parsing implementation so that commands that have the format `command KEYWORDS flag1/value1 flag2/value2` can use the **GenericParser** class. It separates the user input into the keywords, and the flags and their respective values are put into a hash table with the flags as keys.

```

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder. 

#### In Eclipse

* To run all tests, right click on the `src/test/java` folder in the package explorer and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right click on a test package, test class or a test in the package explorer and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`.

#### Using Gradle

* To run all tests, run `gradle test` command in the terminal.

#### Types of Test

##### *Unit Tests*

Example: [`TodayWithTimeParserTest.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C1/main/blob/e850198163971412ddcde7c2da6cbcaf416f77a5/src/test/java/linenux/time/parser/TodayWithTimeParserTest.java)

The **TodayWithTimeParser** class is chosen to be a unit of test. It is considered unit test as the unit
does not interact with other parts of the code. This is achieved by injecting mocked dependencies. In this case,
**TodayWithTimeParser** needs to determine the current time. A mocked **Clock** object is injected and will always return the same
time.

##### *Integration Tests*

Example: [`AddCommandTest.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C1/main/blob/e850198163971412ddcde7c2da6cbcaf416f77a5/src/test/java/linenux/command/AddCommandTest.java#L127-L142)

The `execute_validEvent_taskAdded` test ensures that the **AddCommand**, **Schedule**, **State**, and **Task** classes work in tandem
and produce the expected changes in response to a user input.

Example: [`AutoCompleteTest.java`](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W11-C1/main/blob/e850198163971412ddcde7c2da6cbcaf416f77a5/src/test/java/linenux/gui/AutoCompleteTest.java)

The **AutoCompleteTest** ensures that the **CommandBoxController**, **AutoCompleter**, and **TernarySearchTree** integrates well. This
is done by simulating an actual user interaction and ensure that the expected suggestion show up in the command box.

#### Functional Walkthrough

*This section is a scenario driven, step-by-step introduction on how to use Linenux. For a more in-depth coverage of the commands, refer to our [Commands](#commands) section in the user guide.*

*Step 1: Adding a task.*

You have to buy groceries from the local supermarket today as your relatives are coming to visit for the weekend. You decide to remind youself with the aid of Linenux. Type the following line in the command box:

`> add buy groceries et/today 7.00pm`

*Step 2: Setting a reminder.*

You worry that you might not have enough cash to buy groceries and decide to withdraw money from a nearby ATM machine at your workplace. Type the following line in the command box:

`> remind buy groceries n/withdraw money et/today 6.00pm`

*Step 3: Making spelling mistakes.*

Linenux provides a quick way to fix typing errors. Type the following line in the command box:

`> addd play the piano`

Typing the above line with the spelling mistake will cause a prompt to appear on the bottom-right corner of the window.

`> yes `

Replying yes to the prompt will add the task 'play the piano' without having to type everything again. How convenient!

*Step 4: Marking a task as done.*

It is 8.00pm already and you have just finished buying the groceries. Type the following line in the command box:

`> done buy groceries`

This command will prevent the task from showing up again in subsequent `list` or `today` commands.

*Step 5: Becoming proficient*

You are very impressed with what you have seen thus far and want to learn more about the amazing things you can do with Linenux. Type the following line in the command box:

`> help`

This brings up the list of Linenux commands with their description and format. It is for a quick in-app look-up. Continue to the next section if you want a complete rundown of the details of commands.

## Commands Summary

## Commands

*Notes:*

1. *The `command` word must be the first word in the sentence.*
2. *All commands and their respective fields are case-insensitive.*
3. *The order of the fields do not matter.*
4. *Optional fields are enclosed in square brackets `[]`.*
5. *The notation `...` means that you can have more than one instance of that field.*

#### Adding Tasks and Reminders

##### *Add*

Linenux supports 3 kinds of tasks:

1. **To-dos**    (Tasks without start and end times)
2. **Deadlines** (Tasks with end times only)
3. **Events**    (Tasks with start and end times)

Adding a task has never been this easy. Just indicate the appropriate fields and we will automatically assign the newly created task to one of the three categories above.

*Format:*

`add TASK [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [#/TAG]...`

*Examples:*

```
Explanation: Adding a to-do with tag 'trump'.
> add watch videos on presidential election #/trump

Explanation: Adding a deadline with tags 'household' and 'bills and money'.
> add pay utility bills et/tomorrow 5.00pm #/household #/bills and money

Explanation: Adding an event with tag 'household'.
> add house warming st/tomorrow 7.00pm et/tomorrow 9.00pm #/household
```

##### *Remind*

Setting reminders is as simple as adding a task. Just specify the appropriate fields and we will assign the reminder to the task that you want. Reminders will show up on the display panel upon launch or when the commands `list`, `today` and `tomorrow` are entered.

*Format:*

`remind KEYWORDS t/TIME n/NOTES`

*Examples:*

```
Explanation: Setting a reminder for the event 'house warming' with the note 'buy groceries'.
> remind house warming t/tomorrow 7.00am n/buy groceries
```

*Did you know?*

Have you wondered why we use the word `KEYWORDS` rather than `TASK`? This is because the `remind` command actually searches for task names containing those keywords! For example, consider the scenario below :

```
> add cs2101 assignment et/tomorrow 11.59pm
> add cs2103 assignment et/tomorrow 11.59pm
> remind assignment n/finish assignment t/tomorrow 10.00pm
```

<img src="images/userGuide/multipleResult.png">

In this scenario, since there are multiple task names with the keyword `assignment`, both results are returned and you get to choose, via specifying an index, which task is the reminder for. This searching mechanism is implemented for all commands with the field `KEYWORDS`. How cool is that?

#### Listing Tasks and Reminders

##### *List*

The default behaviour of the `list` command returns the list of all incomplete tasks and reminders. This may not be particularly helpful as you may have a lot of outstanding tasks. Luckily, you are able to search for tasks by specifying the various fields. For example, you can list tasks that have the same tag.

Also, if you need to see the tasks that you have completed, simply add the `d/DONE` field which works as follows:

1. d/yes - Shows only completed tasks.
2. d/all - Shows completed tasks along with incompleted tasks.

*Format:*

`list [KEYWORDS] [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [#/TAG] [d/DONE]`

*Examples:*

```

#### Undoing Previous Command

##### *Undo*

We all make mistakes in life, but we believe in second chances. After all, we are mere mortals. With the `undo` command, we will turn a blind eye to your previous commands. However, do note that not all mistakes can be forgiven. Only the following commands can be undone:

*Undo-able Commands:*

1. `add`
2. `remind`
3. `edit`
4. `editr`
5. `rename`
6. `done`
7. `undone`
8. `delete`
9. `deleter`
10. `clear`

You can undo up to ten such commands.

*Format:*

`undo`

*Example:*

```
Explanation: Undo previous undo-able commands, if any.
> undo
```

```
